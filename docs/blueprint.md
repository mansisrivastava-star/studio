# **App Name**: Turf Wars

## Core Features:

- Location Tracking: Use the device's GPS to track the user's movement in the real world.
- Territory Claiming: As the user moves, claim the ground beneath their feet as their territory. Associate the claimed territory with the user's color.
- Territory Visualization: Display the claimed territory on a map using a unique color for each player. This map needs to be persistent and up to date for all the users.
- Territory Contesting: Detect when a user walks through another player's territory. The territory is then transferred to the new user, changing the territory's color.
- Territory Defense Tool: Utilize AI as a tool, to predict high-traffic routes where other players are likely to contest territory, and display this as an overlay. Use data about user movement patterns over time to refine the predictions.
- Scoreboard: Display a scoreboard ranking players by the area of territory they control. Implement victory and losing conditions and states for each player, which gets visualized and animated.
- Customization: Allow users to choose a unique color to represent their territory.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#6ADE8A) to represent growth, nature, and claiming territory.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A2A2A) for contrast and to highlight the territory colors.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#4EE2EC) to highlight key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent in-app actions and features, prioritizing clarity and immediate recognizability. Keep stroke widths consistent, and ensure shapes are simple and easily digestible.
- Map-centric design with a clean and intuitive interface, ensuring that the map is always visible and easily navigable.
- Subtle animations to highlight territory changes and user interactions, providing real-time feedback and visual appeal.
